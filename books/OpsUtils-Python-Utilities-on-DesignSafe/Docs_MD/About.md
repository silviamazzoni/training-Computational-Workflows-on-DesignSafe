# About This Document

Throughout the notebooks and examples in this book, a **custom Python function library** is used to support common workflow tasks such as job submission, monitoring, file management, and data inspection. This library is stored in **DesignSafe Community Data** and is actively maintained.

* While the library can be copied directly, this is **not recommended**, as it is updated regularly.
* Each notebook includes a **small setup snippet near the top** showing how to reference or copy a stable version of the library into your own workspace. This approach balances reproducibility with ongoing improvements.
