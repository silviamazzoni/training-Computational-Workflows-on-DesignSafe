    "\n",
    "The *getApps()* command in the Tapis API allows you to retrieve a list of registered applications, but it’s more than a simple list function. It supports **query parameters** that let you filter and control what gets returned — making it easier to find only the apps you care about.\n",

    "For example, you can filter by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **App ID or partial ID**\n",
    "* **Owner** (e.g., apps you've registered)\n",
    "* **Execution system**\n",
    "* **Category**\n",
    "* **Search terms in metadata**\n",
