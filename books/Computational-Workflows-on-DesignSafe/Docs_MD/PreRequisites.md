# Prerequisites
***Prerequisites & Recommended Background***

> *You do not need to be an HPC expert to start this module.*

This module assumes a **basic level of computational literacy**, but it is designed to support users who are new to DesignSafe and large-scale computing environments.

**Required background:**

* Comfort running analyses or scripts using **at least one** of the following:

  * Python
  * Shell / command-line tools
  * A domain-specific scientific or engineering application
* Familiarity with basic file concepts such as directories, file paths, and input/output files.

**Helpful (but not required):**

* Prior experience using **Jupyter notebooks** for exploratory analysis or data processing.
* Basic understanding of scripting concepts such as loops, variables, or configuration files.
* Some exposure to remote computing environments (e.g., SSH, cloud VMs, or shared servers).

**Not required:**

* Prior experience with **HPC systems**, **SLURM**, or **TACC**.
* Knowledge of **Tapis**, APIs, or batch job submission.
* Application-specific expertise (examples are provided to illustrate concepts).

Where unfamiliar concepts appear, the module introduces them gradually and focuses on **practical understanding** rather than low-level system details.
