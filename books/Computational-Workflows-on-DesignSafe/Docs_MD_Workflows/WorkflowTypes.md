# Workflow Types

Modern computational research spans a wide range of workflows — from exploratory scripting and visualization to large-scale, long-running simulations. DesignSafe provides multiple compute environments to support this spectrum, each optimized for a different **style of interaction** and **scale of computation**.

At a high level, these environments fall into two workflow categories:
:::{dropdown} **A. Interactive Workflows**: designed for *human-in-the-loop* computing. 
**Interactive workflows** are designed for *human-in-the-loop* computing. You write code, run it, inspect results, modify inputs, and iterate — often many times in a short period.

Typical characteristics:

* Immediate or near-immediate execution
* Direct access to terminals, editors, and notebooks
* Tight feedback loops
* Ideal for development, debugging, testing, and visualization

Examples include:

* Developing Python or Tcl scripts
* Exploring datasets interactively
* Running small to medium test cases
* Automating analyses with immediate feedback

On DesignSafe, interactive workflows are primarily supported through **Jupyter-based environments**, where computation happens inside containerized sessions.
:::

:::{dropdown} **B. Batch Workflows**: optimized for *throughput and scale*. 

**Batch workflows** are optimized for *throughput and scale*. You prepare a job in advance, submit it to a scheduler, and wait for it to run when resources become available.

Typical characteristics:

* Non-interactive execution
* Explicit resource requests (cores, memory, time)
* Jobs may queue before running
* Designed for large, long-running, or parallel computations

Examples include:

* Large simulations
* Parameter sweeps
* MPI-based parallel jobs
* Production or repeated analyses

On DesignSafe and TACC systems, batch workflows are managed by schedulers (such as SLURM) and accessed through **Tapis-based job submission**, whether via command line, web portal, or automation tools.

:::


Interactive and batch workflows are not mutually exclusive.
Effective computational research often uses **both**, selecting the environment that best matches the task at hand.

**A Key Clarification**

Even when launched through a **graphical web interface**, jobs submitted through the DesignSafe Web Portal are **batch jobs**. The interface simplifies submission, but the execution model remains queued, scheduled, and non-interactive.

### How These Fit Together

Rather than competing options, these workflows are **complementary**:

* Interactive workflows accelerate **learning and development**
* Batch workflows enable **scale and performance**
* Many workflows naturally transition from one to another as projects mature

## A Typical Compute Path

Many users naturally follow this progression:

1. Develop and test interactively
2. Validate on small problems
3. Scale up using batch jobs
4. Automate or repeat studies at scale

This transition is expected — and supported — within the DesignSafe ecosystem.

## Why This Matters

Understanding *where* your computation runs — and *how* it is executed — helps you:

* Avoid unnecessary queues
* Use resources efficiently
* Scale smoothly from prototypes to production
* Reduce friction as projects grow
