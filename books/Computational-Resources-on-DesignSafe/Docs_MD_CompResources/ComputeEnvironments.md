# Compute Environments

In this section we introduce the computational ecosystem of **DesignSafe** and **TACC** — explaining how resources are organized, how jobs move through the system, and how users can develop efficient, scalable workflows.

DesignSafe offers three compute environments for developing and running your Workflows:

* The **JupyterHub Environment**, an interactive containerized workspace
* The **OpenSees-Express VM**, a shared virtual machine accessed via the Web Portal or Tapis
* The **HPC Environment** at TACC, accessed SLURM scripts ( + Tapis), ssh, or Jupyter for HPC

Each serves a different purpose in the research workflow.
